# Prerequisites

As previous lab, his lab relies on the linux machines from the [DIIS
deparment](https://diis.unizar.es/es). Either a local machine from the
laboratories, our you can directly connect to `lab000.cps.unizar.es` machine,
which has the same linux machine that the lab machines. So the single actual
prerequisite is to be present in the lab or have an internet-conected computer.
Please remember that your home directory is the same in all the machines of the
department, so you are free to stop and continue working on a different
machine.
