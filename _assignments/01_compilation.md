# First C++ compilation

For this assignment you will only need a C++ compiler. We recommend you to install `g++`, but others such as `clang` can be used as well.
To compile and run a simple C++ program written in a `.cpp` file `<your_file>.cpp`, you just have to run the following commands

```
$ g++ <your_file>.cpp -o your_file
$ ./your_file
```

The first command takes `<your_file>.cpp` as an input for `g++`, and creates an executable file `your_file` in the current folder. 

Now, take the file `hello_world.cpp` in the `src` directory on the repository, compile and execute it. What does it do?
